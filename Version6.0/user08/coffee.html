                                Coffees origins are largely unknown but most scholars agree it is ethiopian. There are many legends about who discovered coffee and when, but there is no substantial proof to back any of these up.
                                <br>
                                In the 15th century coffee was starting to be grown in Arabia. There, they had buildings known as coffee houses. Theses were insanely popular and were the space for many social gatherings. They became so important that many began to call them “Schools of the Wise”.
                                <br>
                                By the 17th century coffee appeared in Europe. Some travelers had brought it back from Arabia and it was instantly a hit. While many people enjoyed the drink, some did not and believed it was made by the devil due to its bitter flavour and dark colour. People tried to ban it in Italy for this reason. Eventually the pope was asked to see if it was the work of the devil. When he tried it he loved it so much he said it was not. Coffee houses began to appear in britain despite some people still being afraid of the drink. These coffee houses were a large success and became centers for social gatherings much like in arabia.

                                Coffee began to become a common drink to have in the morning to get you through the day. The coffee would make people work more due to it being a stimulant. For this reason, coffee was encouraged in certain businesses.
                                <br>
                                Coffee was also brought to New York, commonly known as New Amsterdam at the time. This caused coffee houses to start appearing much like they did in Arabia and England. Before the american civil war, the british imposed a heavy tax on tea, another commonly drank morning beverage. This caused americans to drink more coffee to not have to pay as much.

                                Coffee continued to spread to more parts of the world in the 18th century and now, today, is one of the most drank drinks in america. 74% of americans drink coffee daily and over 2 billion coffees are consumed daily. 
                                <br>
                                To sum it up, coffee is a drink from Ethiopia that spread across the world due to its addictive nature, stimulant qualities, and pleasant taste to most.
